MAILER Agent â€“ Email Classification Assistant

Overview:
- The MAILER Agent is an intelligent assistant that processes emails by classifying them as spam or legitimate.
- For legitimate emails, it detects the intent (e.g., inquiry, complaint, request) and generates a professional draft reply.

- Stores all email interactions in a local JSON log.
- Streamlit GUI for inputting emails, viewing logs, and uploading test emails.
- Export option to download email logs.
